# Congratulations!
### You've just completed your first Rails app.

(Well, they're never _really_ finished... have fun tweaking it!)  
And yes... you get another sticker!

# Extra Credit

If you got all the way through Suggestotron with some time to spare, here's some extra stuff you can try:

* Add a downvote button that does the opposite of what the upvote button does
* Sort topics by their number of votes
* Add an 'about' page, linked from the bottom of the Suggestotron topics list. Link back to the Topics list from the About page so users don't get stranded.
* If your class has a **lot** of time left over:
  * Users should be allowed to vote only once: give votes a user_id and allow a user to have voted on each topic only once. But wait, what is a 'user' in our system? Get a volunteer to introduce everyone to [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise), a simple way to add authentication to a Rails application.
  * Users should be able to give a post a 'negative' vote instead of a positive one. How might you represent that in this system?

### It's Broken! Fix it!

How about you let your teacher break the app you just wrote? We guess you are asking yourself \"why would I do that?\".
Well, **debugging** is a big part of every developer's day.

**Debugging** is the process where you find the problem that causes your application to misbehave or to stop working altogether.
This is a special skill that you will develop throughout your programming career and is hardly ever learnt from a book. It
takes time, patience, and hard work to improve your debugging skill.

The exercises below will give you a sneak peek of how the debugging process is usually done. Call a teacher and let\'s take a look at three fragile points of every Rails application:

  li "Attributes in the attr_accessible collection"
