### Workshop Intro & Closing Presentation Slide Decks

If you can edit HTML, this is the presentation for you. It's the prettiest:

* [Welcome and Closing Reveal.js deck (zip file)](http://cl.ly/0T341w3X130q)

Download, then open up the index.html file in a text editor. Edit pages 0
(dates, location, logo), 1 (sponsor logos), and 7 (after party location), and
you're good to go. (Run it locally for the presentation itself.)


Or make a presentation in the format of your choice. Powerpoint, Keynote, your own [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) deck &mdash; follow your heart!
