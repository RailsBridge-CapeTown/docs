  message "To use the git repository effectively, we must regularly add new changes to it, as this doesn't happen automatically. To do this, we `add` our changes to a staging area in git. Then we `commit` all changes. Once we've committed changes, git creates a new roll back point. We can now undo to this point at any time. The more often we commit, the more fine-grained the undo will be."
